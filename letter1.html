      <p>
        My dearest Diana,<br><br>
        I still remember the first time I saw you—not just with my eyes, but with my soul. Something shifted inside me. I didn’t know what it was at the time, but I felt peace, warmth, and a pull I couldn’t explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your laugh, your calmness, your strength even when sick, your soft voice—everything about you felt like home. And in a world that often made me feel like I didn’t belong, you became my reason to stay grounded, to hope, and to keep going.
      </p>
      <p>
        You once told me that I mattered. That simple phrase stayed with me. So here I am, building a piece of this digital world with you in mind. So that even if words fail me in the real world, they live here, perfectly preserved for your heart alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always yours,<br>
        <strong>Ben Gen 💙</strong>
